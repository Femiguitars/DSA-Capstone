First thing was to input the two given csv files

üìÅ Files: KMS Sql Case Study.csv, Order_Status.csv

```
create database MY_Dsa_Project
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study];
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Order_Status]
```

#### 1. which product category had the highest sales
```
SELECT 
    Product_Category,
    SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Product_Category
ORDER BY [Total Sales] DESC;
```
#### 2. Top and bottom 3 region in sales
```
SELECT TOP 3 
    Region,
    SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY [Total Sales] DESC;

SELECT TOP 3 
    Region,
    SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY [Total Sales] ASC;
```

#### 3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
```
SELECT 
    SUM(Sales) AS [Total Appliance Sales]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
WHERE 
    Product_sub_Category = 'Appliances'
    AND Province = 'Ontario';
```

#### 4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 
10 customers

##### 4.1. Bottom 10 Customers by Total Sales
```
SELECT TOP 10 
    Customer_Name,
    SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales],
    SUM(Profit) AS [Total Profit],
    COUNT(*) AS [Order Count]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY [Total Sales] ASC;
```

##### 4.2. Which segments they belong
```
SELECT 
    Customer_Segment, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT Customer_Name) AS [Total Customers]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Customer_Segment
ORDER BY [Total Customers] ASC;
```

##### 4.3. What products they tend to buy

```
SELECT Customer_Name, Product_Category, SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
WHERE Customer_Name IN (
    SELECT TOP 10 Customer_Name
    FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
    GROUP BY Customer_Name
    ORDER BY SUM(Sales) ASC  
)
GROUP BY Customer_Name, Product_Category
ORDER BY Customer_Name;
```

##### 4.4. Which regions or shipping modes they use
```
SELECT Customer_Name, Region, Ship_Mode, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
WHERE Customer_Name IN (
    SELECT TOP 10 Customer_Name
    FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
    GROUP BY Customer_Name
    ORDER BY SUM(Sales) ASC 
)
GROUP BY Customer_Name, Region, Ship_Mode;
```

```
After analyzing the sales data, the bottom 10 customers 
have low revenue contributions and limited order frequency.
Most of them belong to the Small Business, consumer,  Home office segments and tend to buy Furnitures, office supplies, Technology e.t.c..

To increase revenue from these customers, KMS should:
1. Implement targeted promotions based on their purchase history.

2. Offer personalized product bundles to encourage larger order sizes.

3. Introduce loyalty incentives for repeat orders.

4. Use cost-effective shipping incentives to improve margins.

These steps can help re-engage these low-performing customers and convert them into higher-value clients.******
